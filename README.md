# Hypatia 3301
Welcome to Hypatia 3301. This is an ARG built in similar fashion as the elusive Cicada 3301, but with less QAnon roots.

-> This project ended up being a nightmare to debug, but now I have the chance to make it really special. I spent 14 straight hours sifting through node modules just to get a single page to load after installing a (shortcut) way for styling. Lesson learned? Just give myself more time for styling. Use time management apps. Stop complaining.

# Who Is That?

This is exactly what we are trying to find out. What actually *is* Mambascript? Not to mention the many puzzles to solve along the way.  

Good luck, you'll need it. And perhaps a spectral analyzer wouldn't hurt, too.
